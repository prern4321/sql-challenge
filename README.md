QuickDBD was used to visulize the relationship of data provided in 6 separate csv files for developing a SQL database for employees in a major corporation hired during the 1980's to 1990's. 

2. Data Engineering
Table Schema for each of the 6 csv's were generated by specifying data types, Primary & Foreign Keys and other constraints om Postgresql. The Schema is illustrated in EMPLOYEES_DB2_Schema.sql file

3. Data Analysis
